# PigLatinTranslator
An English-to-Pig-Latin Translator program in Python.

This is just a practice project for myself, feel free to fork, but I will NOT be accepting any Push Requests.

This is a simple project dealing with the manipulation of strings in Python!  MVP (Minimum Viable Product) is to run this in the command line, stretch goal being to learn how to code a pretty looking frontend GUI (which is something I have never done in Python before)!The definition of Pig Latin can found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin
